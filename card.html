                            to support you in your ridiculousness,
                            that respects that you are free,
                            to accompany you on your flight,
                            Don't be afraid of falling.</p>


                        <p class="text"> Woman, you are free, you are great, don't let anyone make you think otherwise. You were
                            born to shine,
                            to break obstacles and every barrier in your path, to dance in the rain and fall in love
                            with your grace and your words.
